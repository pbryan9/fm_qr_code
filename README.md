### What I learned

This is just the first of hopefully many Frontend Mentor projects. I think it's a super useful platform that I expect I'll learn quite a lot from. In this particular project I didn't really tap into anything especially new, but I can say I've not used styled-components very much at all and it was good to get the practice of setting it up & getting more accustomed to the (honestly pretty easy) syntax.
